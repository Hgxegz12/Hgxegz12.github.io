									<p> Arguments Against the Idea </p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/argument.jpeg" height="400" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The theory of Continental Drift was not widely accepted and there were two main 
									arguemnts for this
								</p>
								<p> 1.) What mechanism could move the continents </p>
								<p> In the early 1900's our technology was nowhere near what we have now. When thinking about
									something as big a continent moving, it's hard to wrap your head around it. Even if Wegener 
									was making good points, this doesn't change the fact that the people didn't know how the continents 
									were moving which caused doubt within the community.
								</p>
								<p> 2.) Validity of the Evidence </p>
								<p> Wegener had 5 main pieces of evidence that supported his thesis of continental motion. 
									1.) Jigsaw puzzle fit, 2.) same geological formations in different continents, 3.) fossil species 
									in different continents, 4.) location of glacial morained indicated that continentws had different 
									relations to the poles compared to now, 5.) Geodetic difference between Greenland and Europe 
									was increasing. 
								</p>
								<p>Other geologists argued that the formation of the same rock does not have to be in the same location. There 
									could have been a coincidence that the rocks matched. Along with this the idea of land bridges combatted
									his argument of fossils in different locations. As for the geodetic evidence, they believed it was just an error 
									in calculation.
								</p>
								<p> The reasons and explanations above are the reason that the idea of continental drift was not accepted 
									until later on when more evidence would be presented.
