								<p>1.) Continent Pieces Fit Together </p>
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/puzzle.jpeg" width="200" 
									height="200" alt="" /></a>
								<p> When we look at a map of the Earth we will notice something interesting about it.
									If you were to try and connect the continents together like a puzzle, you will notice
									that they actully do fit nicely into each other. This is one piece of evidence that led
									to the idea of plate tectonics. The fact that the continents were all connected at one
									point means that they have been moving away from each other.
								</p>
								<p>2.) Fossil Evidence/ Geological Evidence </p>
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/fossil.jpeg" width="200" 
									height="200" alt="" /></a>
								<p> Next up is fossil and geological evidence. Alfred Wegener didn't just study the rock formations during his 
									journeys, he also studied the environment, specifically fossils that each continent had. What
									does this mean though? After careful observation of the fossils and their locations, we can see 
									a pattern that leads us to believe that the continents were connected. Similar fossils were found 
									scattered through different continents. Specifcally, fossils of organisms that could not survive
									the current environment of the land now. This led people like Wegener to believe that the continents 
									were connected which allowed for animals and species to move across the continent. Now that they are 
									spread apart, we know that they had to be at a travelable distance at the time. This is the same for rock 
									formations; Wegener noticed that the same type of rocks seemed to be continuous across different 
									continents. 
								</p>
								<p>3.) Distance Differences </p>
								<p> In different travels that Wegener had gone on, he took the distance from Greenland and Europe. In two different 
									explorations that he went on, the distance between the two locations were growing further, implying 
									that these two places were moving away from each other due to plate movement. 
								</p>
								<p>4.) Earthquake and Volcano Plate Boundaries</p>
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/mappy.jpeg" width="200" 
									height="200" alt="" /></a>
								<p> Another piece of evidence that shows us more clearly that the idea of continental drift
									makes sense is using earthquake and volcano mappings. From the image above we can see that that 
									the activities seem to outline the plates nicely. This makes sense since the cause of an earthquake
									and a volcano is caused by movement of the plates which causes the ground to move or open up. This is
									one of the new forms of evidence to support the idea of continental drift just because the technology
									to retrieve this kind of information was not available yet. More information will continue to come out as 
									we explore more of the Earth and keep advancing technologically.
