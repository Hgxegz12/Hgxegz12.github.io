									<p>Who is Alfred Wegener?</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/weggy.jpeg" height="400" alt="" /></div>
								<p> Alfred Wegener was a German meteorologist and geophysicist and is credited with 
									coming up with the idea of continental drift. This idea made him one of the most important
									and significant figures in geological science and science in general. Wegener's inital
									proposal is that the continents were once united into a single supercontinent known as Pangaea,
									which means all earth in ancient Greek. Wegener suggested that Pangaea broke up long ago and 
									that the continents then moved to their current positions. To everyone reading this now, 
									it all makes sense that this is how the Earth's plates moved and we all accept it as a fact today.
								</p>
								<p>However, this was not the case for Alfred Wegener during this time. While alive, most scientists
									did not take this idea seriously, mainly because they couldn't fathom the idea of continents moving
									across the ocean. 
								</p>
								<p> So how did Wegner even think about this theory? Well, he was given the opportunity to travel to 
									Greenland multiple times and in these explorations, his goial was to map Greenland's unexplored
									northeast coast. After observing the land and the environment of different continents on his explorations
									he started to notice some things that would lead to his idea of continental drift. 
								</p>
								<p> Wegener noticed that the mapping of the continents seemed to fit together like a puzzle piece,
									as if they were just disconnected from each other. He also noticed different fossil similarities in differnt 
									continents along with geological similarities. This led him to believe that it might be possible,
									that the continents were actually connected at one point and split up over time, which led to the 
									theory of continental drift.
